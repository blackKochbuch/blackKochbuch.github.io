INSTRUCTIONS
	1	Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and set a roasting sheet pan inside to warm.
	2	Using a mortar and pestle, crush garlic with salt until smooth. Add coriander and cumin and continue crushing. Mix in parsley and dill.
	3	Pat the fish dry, inside and out. Remove the dark vein that runs along the back of the cavity, if it's still there. And if needed, run your knife along the cavity to open it up some more. Salt generously inside and on both sides outside, then place on a lightly oiled piece of foil that is large enough to enclose the fish.
	4	Stuff the fish cavity with lemon slices and the garlic and herb mixture you just prepared. Drizzle generously with olive oil.
	5	Fold the foil over the fish lengthwise, tightly closing the top seam to trap the steam. Place the foiled fish on top of the hot sheet pan and bake in the 350 degrees F heated-oven for 30-40 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish.
	6	Remove from heat and add the lemon juice. Serve immediately with suggested sides and salads (see ingredient list).

Or
	•	Preheat the oven to 450 F. Line a large baking sheet with a parchment paper or aluminum foil. Grease the aluminum foil with a drizzle of oil to prevent fish from sticking. No need to grease the parchment paper. 
	•	Combine listed marinade ingredients in a blender or a food processor. Blend it until smooth (coarse is fine, you do you!)
	•	Score the clean and gutted fish through skin and flesh on both sides and pat dry it with paper towel.
	•	Place Mackerel on the greased baking sheet. Apply marinade inside the scoring, in the guts, and on the skin on both sides. 
	•	Bake on top rack at 450 F for 20-25 minutes uncovered. Broil for a minute. Serve it hot with a generous drizzle of lemon juice and your favorite fish dinner side dish. 
Notes
	1	Double the marinate amount for 2 to 3 whole mackerel. Approximate cooking time for 2 to 3 whole fish should stay the same. 
	2	Let the marinated fish rest in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to an hour for better flavor results.
	3	Cooking time may vary depending on the size of the whole mackerel. Generally 12-15 Oz fish takes about 20-25 minutes at 450 F to fully cook through. Smaller fish can take less time. Mackerel fillets take 12-15 minutes at 450 F to fully cook through. Broiling the fish for that 1 minute gives such a beautiful chard flavor to the skin.
