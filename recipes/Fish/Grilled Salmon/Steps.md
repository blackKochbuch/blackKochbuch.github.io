To get a crispy skin, fish needs to be dry! Pat dry, 
 If time permits, leave the salmon skin side up in the fridge for an hour or so
put in fridge without packaging

Take out early, 

Salt, pepper and oil (well!) fish on both sides, only right before bowing

Grill needs to be HOT 600
Skin down, close lid
If you want to turn, grill first 90% on skin, then 10% on flesh

Duration depends on thickness.
