Instructions
﻿﻿﻿Make the avocado chimichurri. Ad the chimichurri ingredients to a food processor and blend together until smooth. Taste and adjust the black pepper (if needed) then cover and keep refrigerated until ready to serve.
﻿﻿﻿

Preheat the oven. Turn your oven on to 400 degrees and spray a baking dish with cooking spray.
﻿﻿﻿Prepare the salmon. Pat the salmon fillets with a paper towel to remove any excess moisture then place them in the prepared baking dish. In a small bowl, whisk the olive oil, lime juice and chopped cilantro together. Brush the mixture over each fillet and season them with smoked paprika, salt and black pepper to your liking.
﻿﻿﻿Bake! Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.
﻿﻿﻿Serve. Serve warm with a dollop of avocado chimichurri spooned over each fillet.
