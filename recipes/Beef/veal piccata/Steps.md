Directions
		Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F.
		Coat a large saute pan with olive oil and toss in the garlic cloves. Bring the pan to a medium-high heat. Cook the garlic until it becomes golden brown and is very aromatic. Remove the garlic and discard. Raise heat to high.
		Sprinkle the veal scallops with salt. Just before placing the veal scallops in the pan with the hot oil, dredge them in flour. Working in batches, flour the veal that is going directly in the pan; do not flour ahead. When the veal has browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side, remove to a platter and keep warm in the oven.
		When all the veal has been browned, ditch the oil in the pan. Add the wine and capers and reduce by half. Add in the chicken stock, season with salt, and cook until it has slightly thickened. Swirl in the butter. When the butter has melted and is bubbly, add in the lemon juice. Taste to make sure it is delicious, add the parsley, and spoon over the veal.
