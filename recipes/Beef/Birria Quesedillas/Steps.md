1. Mix all the ingredients except the meat, broth, and vinegar in a pan/pot
2. Fry them up a bit and add water until they are pretty much submerged
3. Put a lid on and let it simmer for 25 minutes or until it's all mushed together a bit
4. Put in a blender and blend until smooth
5. Add the vinegar and broth and mix
6. Optionally, sear the meat on all sides by heating oil in a pan and adding the meat once it's hot
7. Put the meat and the sauce all together and slow cook it for 3-4 hours (on stove) or 10-12 hours in a slow cooker
8. Near the end, shred the meat, which should be very tender, and let it cook a bit more to let the juices soak in
9. Enjoy in a burrito or taco, or put in a tortilla with some cheese and fry on a pan to make quesedillas!
10. Pour leftover sauce on top and serve with fresh guac, beans, lettuce, cheese. Yum!
