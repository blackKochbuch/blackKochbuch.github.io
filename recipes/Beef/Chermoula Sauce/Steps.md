	•	Fresh parsley
	•	Fresh cilantro
	•	Garlic cloves – I’m a massive garlic lover, and one or two cloves were more than enough garlic for me. But simply add more for if you want an extra garlicky taste.
	•	Ground coriander
	•	Red pepper flakes
	•	Paprika
	•	Ground ginger
	•	Saffron threads – saffron is optional in this recipe. While it is a nice addition, it will not make or break your chermoula sauce. If you don’t have any on hand, feel free to leave the saffron out!
	•	Kosher salt
	•	Fresh lemon juice and zest
	•	Extra virgin olive oil
	•	
	•	Combine the herbs and other ingredients in your food processor. Grab a large food processor and make sure it is fitted with a blade. Add the fresh cilantro and fresh parsley. Be sure to trim a bit off the stem, but not too much: The stems have a lot of flavor, too! Throw in the rest of your ingredients (except the olive oil).
	•	Blend. Run the food processor very briefly and drizzle the olive oil from the top opening while it is still running. Watch it as it blends. This step should not take very long at all. A few pulses should give you perfectly combined chermoula. Don’t over-process the mixture; chermoula is not meant to be a runny sauce! It should still have a little texture to it at the end. Once it looks like the flavors have melded, turn off your food processor.
