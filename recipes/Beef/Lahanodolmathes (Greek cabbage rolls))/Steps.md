		1 Place cabbage in a large pot of boiling water and cover pot.
		When the outer leaves are blanched and softened, remove leaf by leaf, keeping the leaves whole, and place flat on a towel on work surface.
		Continue in this way, removing leaves as they become blanched and soft.
		Take some leaves that have not removed in one piece (the worse looking ones, or chop up some cabbage) and put in the bottom of a large pot.

		
		2 Combine ground meat with rice, onion, parsley (cilantro), carrot, 2 TBS tomato paste, garlic. Season with salt, lemon pepper, pepper. .
		
		3 Take a cabbage leaf and place 2 TBS of meat filling in the center.
		Fold both sides in and start rolling up, away from you, to make a cylinder, like an egg-roll or cigar. Do this rather loosely to allow for expansion of the meat and rice as it cooks. 
		
		4 Pour a little olive oil in non stick pot
		5 Lay rolls neatly in pot, packing them in next to one another so they hold their shape.
		
		
		5 Put more torn cabbage leaves or chopped up cabbage over the cabbage rolls.
		
		6 Add stock, tomato sauce, enough hot water to just cover the cabbage rolls by ½”.
		
		7 Weight the cabbage rolls with a plate and bring to the boil (the plate keeps the rolls from moving around too much as they cook, so that they don’t unroll).
		
		8 Cook for just over an hour.
		
		9 Carefully remove cabbage rolls to serving dish
		
		10 Make your sauce using the liquid remaining in pot.
		11 Beat the eggs with the corn flour and lemon juice.
		12 Very carefully and very slowly and whisking all the time, start to dribble the hot stock into the egg mixture. Keep doing this until you’ve added nearly all the stock. This tempers your eggs so that your sauce won’t curdle.
		13 Season with beef bouillon, pepper, salt, red wine
		14 Pour the sauce back into the pot, and cook until the sauce just starts to simmer.
		15 Remove from heat and serve with the cabbage rolls coated generously with this sauce.(Not so sure here, makes it look less nice)
