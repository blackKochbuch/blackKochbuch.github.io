		Preheat oven to 300 °F (150 °C)
		Season roast with salt and pepper.
		In a skillet, melt butter with oil over medium-high heat and brown the veal fillet for 2 minutes on each side.Transfer meat to an ovenproof dish and roast for 1 hour or until internal temperature reaches 140°F (61°C).
		In the same skillet, sauté the onions. Add the veal stock, mustard, maple syrup and tarragon to the sautéed onions.
		Mix and bring to a boil. Reduce over medium heat for 10 minutes, or until almost no liquid remains.
		Pour in the cream and cook for another 1 minute until the sauce thickens a little. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning, if necessary.
		Remove the veal from the oven and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes in aluminum foil.
		Slice roast into 1-inch thick medallions. Top with mustard sauce and maple syrup.

For the red  wine sauce:
	•	1 large shallot, minced
	•	2 sprigs fresh thyme
	•	1 bay leaf
	•	1/2 cup dry red wine (preferably one with soft tannins like a Pinot Noir or a Merlot)
	•	3 ounces Demi-Glace de Veau Gold® (or Demi-Glace Gold®)
	•	1 cup water
	•	Salt and ground black pepper
	•	1 tablespoon unsalted butter
	•	1 veal tenderloin (usually about 1 1/4 pounds)
	•	Olive oil
	•	Kosher salt
	•	Cracked black peppercorns
	•	1 tablespoon unsalted butter
	•	2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh rosemary
Methods/Steps
	1	First make the sauce: Combine the shallot, thyme sprigs, bay leaf and red wine in a medium saucepan.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook until the wine is reduced by half, to about 1/4 cup.
	2	Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the Demi-Glace de Veau Gold® and the water, whisking until the Demi-Glace de Veau Gold® dissolves completely.  Bring the sauce to a simmer, and cook for 15 minutes, reducing the heat as needed to keep it just at a simmer.
	3	Season to taste with salt and pepper and whisk in the butter.  Strain the sauce through a sieve and reheat gently before serving.
	4	To roast the veal: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Trim the silverskin from the tenderloin, rub it with olive oil, and season it liberally with kosher salt and cracked pepper.
	5	Place the tenderloin in a shallow roasting pan and roast it for 15-20 minutes.  Check the internal temperature by inserting an instant-read thermometer halfway into the thickest part of the meat.  For rare veal, remove the tenderloin from the oven at 120 degrees, for medium rare remove it at 125 degrees.  If the veal is not yet at the temperature you want, return it to the oven, and check the temperature again every 5-7 minutes.
	6	When the veal is done, transfer it to a cutting board, cover it loosely with aluminum foil, and let it rest for 5-10 minutes.
	7	To serve, carve the veal into slices and ladle the sauce over them.
