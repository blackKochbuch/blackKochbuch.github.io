Directions
1	Use a sharp knife or scissors to remove silverskin and trim excess fat from tenderloin. Fold the thinner end under to approximate the thickness of the rest of the roast and tie with butcher's twine to secure. Tie tenderloin in 1 1/2- to 2-inch intervals to help it keep its shape during cooking.
2	Mix together garlic, oil, rosemary, pepper, thyme, and salt in a small bowl; rub over tenderloin to coat. Let sit while you preheat the grill.
3	Light a charcoal fire in one half of a charcoal grill or preheat a gas grill to high for 10 minutes and lightly oil the grate.
4	Place tenderloin on the hot grill and close the lid. Grill until well-seared, about 5 minutes. Flip and repeat on the other side.
5	Move tenderloin to the cool side of the charcoal grill, or if using a gas grill, turn off the burner directly underneath the tenderloin and turn the remaining one or two burners (depending on grill style) to medium. Cook until rosy pink and a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest section registers 130 degrees F (54 degrees C), 45 to 60 minutes. Cook time will depend on tenderloin size and grill.
6	Let tenderloin rest 15 minutes before carving.
we used a grilling mat after searing to keep it from burning and only cooked it for 20 minutes on med/low heat.

To ensure I produced a perfect medium-rare roast, I took the roast off at 125F and lightly tented it while resting (about 10 min). I left the temperature probe in while resting (the meat rose to 135F). Turned out fantastic!

Finish in oven 325?
five pound roast was just enough for 6 adult eaters with no leftovers.

We changed the pre-cook method by liberally salting the meat after trimming, then wrapping in plastic wrap and placing into the refrigerator. One hour before started cooking, we removed from the fridge and applied the marinade, leaving the roast out to warm up a little. We did a liberal coating of butter prior to putting it into the oven and used the Cook's Illustrated method for cooking tenderloin by the Low and Slow method at 300 degrees until coming to 120 degrees and then throwing on a blazing hot grill to sear the outside for a crust. You may also sear in a pan or griddle. Then before serving, we applied another layer of butter. There was none left out of a ten pound tenderloin, and I didn't even get but a bite. I saw grown men, in cocktail attire, standing at the buffet slipping slices of the tender meat and eating it out of their hands. Many, many compliments!

Perfectly cooked interior. For a roast that is a rosy-pink medium-rare from edge to center, we grill it over indirect heat for a gentle, low-and-slow approach.Deeply browned exteriorTo produce lots of flavorful browning without overcooking the roast, we rub the tenderloin with baking soda before grilling. The soda speeds up the Maillard reaction by raising the meat’s pH. Oil as wellGood grilled flavorDrippings are key for grilled flavor—they hit the coals (charcoal) or heat diffusers (gas), change chemically into new flavor compounds, and then vaporize, waft up, and stick to the food. Since tenderloin produces very little in the way of drippings, we grill our tenderloin alongside slices of skewered bacon, which provide the necessary drippings.

Two secrets for the best beef tenderloin roast
Now, how to best cook beef tenderloin? Roasting your tenderloin low and slow is key here, but two secrets make all the difference:
•	Salt and air-chill your beef tenderloin in the fridge for a few hours or overnight before you roast it! Salting the tenderloin well on all sides will infuse the meat with flavor (remember, this cut has little fat and therefore needs flavor). Do this one night ahead and allow the tenderloin to sit in the fridge, uncovered overnight. By generously salting the meat and then chilling it for several hours, you allow the surface of the meat to dry out. This might seem counter-productive to producing a juicy beef tenderloin but removing the surface moisture helps the meat to brown quickly, and slow-roasting lets the meat cook steadily, retaining its juiciness. (BTW, this trick works well on turkey breast and roast chicken as well.)
•	Reverse sear your roast beef tenderloin. Reverse searing is a technique where instead of searing the meat at the beginning, you roast it low and slow for a few hours, then at the very end, you finish it under the direct heat of your broiler to get the perfect sear on the outside. By roasting the meat on low heat for a few hours, you allow it to cook to the same temperature all the way through, instead of having it be more done on the outside than in the middle. Searing the tenderloin at the end adds beautiful color and the most delicious crispy crust.
How long should you cook it?
Slow-roasted tenderloin in a 225 degrees F heated oven will take 50 minutes per pound for a medium-rare roast (internal temperature at 135 degrees F after the meat has rested).

Beef tenderloin temperatures guide
Beef tenderloin roast is best served rare or medium-rare with an internal temperature at around 135 degrees . Use a meat thermometer to determine if the roast is done, and remember that the temperature of the meat will rise as it rests for 15 minutes or so before serving. Here is a quick guide:
	•	Rare: 125°F after the meat has rested. Remove the roast from your oven when its internal temperature reaches 115°F.
	•	Medium-Rare: 135°F after the meat has rested. Remove the roast from the oven when its internal temperature reaches 125°F.
	•	Medium: 145°F after the meat has rested. Remove the roast from the oven when its internal temperature reaches 135°F.
	•	Medium-Well: 155°F after the meat has rested. Remove the roast from the oven when its internal temperature reaches 145°F.
	•	Center-cut beef tenderloin – 2 to 3 pounds
	•	Kosher salt and black pepper – To season the beef before it is air-chilled overnight
	•	Extra virgin olive oil – Brush the tenderloin on all sides with good EVOO after it has slow-roasted, and put it under the broiler to sear.
	•	Optional Chermoula sauce and pomegranate seeds to serve.  The fresh, herby chermoula sauce adds a Mediterranean twist to the tenderloin, while pomegranate seeds lend the dish a festive air as well as a nice crunch. Feel free to finish with your choice of sauce and garnish instead!
	•	Season and chill the beef tenderloin. The night before (if possible), season it with kosher salt and black pepper on all sides. Be very generous with the salt, this is key to flavor. (If you forget, just do this as soon as you remember).
	•	Truss the tenderloin. Grab some kitchen twine and cut it into pieces. Tie the tenderloin in roughly one-inch increments. (This is trussing.) I like to truss the meat to help it hold its shape. Trussing the tenderloin also helps to make slicing easier once the roast is ready, since you already have a guide for how to cut even pieces. Don’t have kitchen twine? Don’t worry! Simply leave your seasoned beef tenderloin as is and jump to the next step.
	•	Air-chill the beef. Top a large sheet pan with a wire rack and place the tenderloin on the rack. Refrigerate, uncovered, overnight. Leaving the beef tenderloin uncovered in the fridge helps to dry out the surface moisture, which helps with browning later. Placing the meat on a wire rack instead of directly on a sheet pan allows air to circulate all around the beef (including underneath), ensuring all sides become dry in the fridge. (Even 30 minutes or 1 hour in the fridge will help)
Slow-roast the tenderloin. On the center rack of a 225 degrees F-heated oven, slow roast the beef tenderloin. Roast for 2 to 3 hours, or until a meat thermometer inserted into the beef reads 125 degrees F. Remove from the oven and set aside to rest. (The temperature will continue to rise while resting.) Note: If you are serving this with my delicious chermoula sauce, you can make it according to this recipe while the beef is roasting.
Sear under the broiler. Place a rack 6 inches away from the broiler and turn it on. Brush the tenderloin on all sides with some extra virgin olive oil, and place it under the broiler. Broil for about 2 minutes, turning every few seconds until browned on all sides. A meat thermometer should read somewhere between 125 and 130 degrees F for medium-rare (If you like your meat more cooked, you can allow it more time in the oven).
	•	Allow the meat to rest. Remove the tenderloin from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes (15 to 20 or so). Cut off and discard the twine.
	•	Slice and serve. Slice the tenderloin into 1-inch-thick rounds. (The twine marks will help guide you.) Arrange the slices on a platter and drizzle with chermoula. Garnish with pomegranate seeds
