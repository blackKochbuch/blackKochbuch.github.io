To a large pan (make sure Spaghetti fit flat in it) add enough oil to cover the surface.
Add garlic and chilli, cook for only a few seconds so the garlic doesn’t burn.
Add the tomato sauce and cook so it reduces down into a thicker sauce. Add salt and pepper to taste



While the sauce cooks, prepare the tomato stock. In saucepan add 500 ml water, the tomato paste and a pinch of salt. Mix

When the tomato sauce is ready add the spaghetti straight into the pan, cover with the tomato sauce and let it cook. The trick here is to cook as long as possible without adding any tomato water, you want to try to create a little crust and almost ‘burn’ the spaghetti. If it looks like it’s about to burn you know it’s time to add a little tomato water, one big scoop at the time (cook like you would risotto)


Add more water and when it dries out add water again. Repeat until the pasta is perfectly cooked. It will take longer than the usual to cook your pasta but it will be worth it!
