To a large pan (spaghetti need to fit in flat) add enough oil to cover the surface
Add garlic and chilli, cook for only a few seconds
Add tomato sauce and cook, so it reduces down into a thicker sauce, add salt and pepper to taste

While sauce cooks prepare the tomato stock. In a saucepan add 500 ml boiling water to tomato paste and a pinch of salt. Mix
when the sauce is ready add the spaghetti right into the pan, cover with tomato sauce and let it cook. The trick is to cook as long as possible without adding tomato water. You want to create a little crust and almost burn the spaghetti. If it looks like it is about to burn, you know it is time to add the tomato water, one big scoop at a time (cook as if it were risotto)

Add more water if it dries out. Repeat until pasta is perfectly cooked
