		Peel the beets and cut them into 3/4-inch cubes. Arrange the cubes in an even layer on the prepared baking sheet.
		Drizzle the beets with the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and honey. Sprinkle with the salt and black pepper. Use a rubber spatula to toss the beets until they are evenly coated.
		Roast the beets on middle rack of oven, stirring twice during the cook time, until the beets are fork-tender and slightly caramelized, 45-55 minutes.
		Check to see that beets are done. Remove from oven or add time as needed.
		Drizzle beets with additional balsamic vinegar, if desired, and serve.
