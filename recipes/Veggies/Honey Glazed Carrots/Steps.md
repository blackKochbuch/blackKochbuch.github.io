Instructions
		Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
		In a large bowl, toss the carrots in the olive oil, honey, salt, and pepper until well coated.
		Spread the carrots out in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Also, avoid overcrowding, or they’ll steam instead of roast.
		Roast for about 45 - 25 minutes, or until the carrots are tender and caramelized.
		Garnish with parsley, if desired. Serve and enjoy!
