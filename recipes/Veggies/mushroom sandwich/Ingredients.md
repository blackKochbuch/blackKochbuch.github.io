Chunky chive oil
﻿﻿1/2 cup finely chopped fresh chives

To assemble
﻿﻿2 large slices sourdough, toasted

NOTES
﻿﻿When you begin, it might appear as though you have an abundance of mushrooms, but as they roast, they'll shrink by almost two-thirds of their volume. This reduction is crucial for achieving the ideal meaty roasted texture that we desire in this dish.

﻿﻿While roasting the mushrooms, make sure to toss them halfway through cooking to ensure even roasting and a uniform golden colour.

Additionally, you can prepare the mushrooms in advance, a day or two before. When ready to serve, simply reheat them in the oven for about 5-10 minutes.
