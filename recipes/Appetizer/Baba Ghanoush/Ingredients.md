2 eggplants

2 cloves garlic
Fresh cilantro

	•	2 tablespoons lemon juice, more if necessary
	•	¼ cup tahini
	•	⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing the eggplant and garnish
	•	2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, plus extra for garnish
	•	¾ teaspoon salt, to taste
	•	¼ teaspoon ground cumin
	•	Pinch of smoked paprika, for garnish


Tahini:
For 1/2 cup
1 cup (140g) sesame seeds, we prefer hulled
2 to 4 tablespoons neutral flavored oil such as avocado,  grape seed, vegetable or a light olive oil
Pinch of salt, optional

	•	TOAST SESAME SEEDS
	•	1Add sesame seeds to a wide, dry saucepan over medium-low heat and toast, stirring constantly until the seeds become fragrant and turn light golden in color, 3 to 5 minutes. Be careful; sesame seeds can burn quickly. 
	•	MAKE TAHINI
	•	1Add the toasted sesame seeds to the bowl of a food processor, then process until a crumbly paste, about 1 minute. 2Add 2 tablespoons of the oil, then process for 2 to 3 minutes more, stopping to scrape the bottom and sides of the food processor a couple of times. 3Check the tahini’s consistency. It should be smooth, not gritty, and should be pourable. You may need to process for another minute and add 1 to 2 more tablespoons of oil. 4Taste the tahini for seasoning, then add salt to taste. Process 5 to 10 seconds to mix. 5Store tahini in an airtight container for one month. It might separate over time like a natural peanut butter would. If this happens, give the tahini a good stir before using it.
