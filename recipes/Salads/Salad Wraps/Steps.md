	•	Whisk together sauce ingredients until well combined. If you use a firmer peanut butter you may need to microwave the mixture for 30-60 seconds in order to melt it and ensure everything is well-mixed.
	•	Heat 2 TBS peanut oil in a frying pan. Once hot, add ground chicken.
	•	Cook until some pieces are starting to brown. Add onion and cook for 5 minutes or until the onion is becoming translucent.
	•	Add the peppers and water chestnuts and cook about 5 minutes or until peppers are becoming soft.
	•	Add sauce and simmer on low heat until the chicken and veggies are evenly coated and everything is heated through.
	•	Serve in lettuce leaves, on top of your favorite Asian salad, or over noodles or rice!
