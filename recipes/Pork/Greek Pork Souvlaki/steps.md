	In a large bowl or zip lock bag, combine the white wine vinegar, olive oil, garlic cloves, mustard, oregano, rosemary, paprika, and black pepper. 
Add the pork and toss well to combine. Cover or seal and refrigerate for at least two hours. If you have the time, allow the meat to marinate overnight.  
	Remove the bowl from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before you are ready to grill. If you are using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 30-40 minutes so they do not burn on the grill. 

	Slice the onion into quarters and pull apart the layers. Thread the marinated pork through the skewers, alternating with red onion pieces. Depending on the size of the skewers you are using, the quantity of meat will be enough for 4 large or 6 smaller skewers. 
Season the meat with the sea salt and brush everything with the remaining marinade. Grill for about 4 minutes per side, turning to ensure a nice color on all sides. When the meat is done it should have solid grill marks and an internal temperature of 145° F. 
Remove the skewers from the grill and place them on a serving platter. Cover them loosely with foil and allow them to rest for 4-5 minutes. 
Slice the lemon in half and squeeze on some fresh lemon juice.
