INSTRUCTIONS
	•	Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
	•	In a large mixing bowl, stir together the dry ingredients: flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, baking soda and cream of tartar.
	•	Then slice the cold butter into small pieces and cut the butter into the dry ingredients with a pastry cutter, knife or pastry blender.
	•	Then stir in the cold Buttermilk into the bowl just until a dough is formed.  The dough will be sticky.
	•	On a floured working surface, roll the dough out until it’s approximately 1/2” thick.  Then sprinkle the top of the dough with flour so that the cutter doesn’t stick to the dough.
	•	Use a 2.5 inch or 3 inch biscuit cutter or the top of a round glass to cut the biscuits out of the dough.  Do not twist the biscuit cutter when cutting out the biscuits.  Just gently shake the cutter or glass so that the biscuit falls out.
 
•	Then place the cut out biscuits on the prepared baking sheet.
	•	Bake for 14-17 minutes until the top of the biscuits are lightly golden brown.
	•	After the cooking time, let the biscuits cool for 5 minutes, then top them with the melted butter and serve!

RECIPE NOTES

Store the leftover biscuits in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.

Awesome! I did one thing different i did not knead the dough 10 times. I patted the dough out folded it in half turned 90 degree and repeated 4 times ( laminated) after cutting i put them in the refrigerator 20 minutes while I preheated oven to 500. Put biscuits in for 2 minutes and then lowered heat to 425 for the remaining time. Better than KFC
