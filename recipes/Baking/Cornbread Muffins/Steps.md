Step 1
Preheat oven to 400°. Generously coat a standard 12-cup muffin pan with nonstick spray.
Step 2
Whisk flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, kosher salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Stir in 1½ cups corn.
Step 3
Lightly whisk eggs and egg yolk in a medium bowl, then whisk in sour cream, milk,
and butter.
Step 4
Create a well in the center of dry ingredients. Pour egg mixture into well and stir with a wooden spoon until batter is just combined.
Step 5
Divide batter among prepared muffin cups. Top with remaining ½ cup corn, then sprinkle with sea salt.
Step 6
Bake muffins, rotating pan halfway through, until tops are golden brown and a tester
inserted into the center comes out clean, 18–20 minutes. Let cool slightly in pan. Transfer muffins to a wire rack and eat while warm or let cool completely.
Step 7
