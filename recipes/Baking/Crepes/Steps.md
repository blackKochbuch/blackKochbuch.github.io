	•	In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Crack the eggs into the bowl and whisk until smooth. Gradually pour in the milk while whisking continuously until the batter is smooth and thin enough to pour. 
	•	For large (10-inch) crepes heat a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. For smaller (6-inch) crepes, use an 8-inch nonstick skillet. Add 1/2 tablespoon of butter and allow it to melt, coating the surface of the pan evenly. 
	•	Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the skillet and tilt the pan in a circular motion to spread the batter into a thin, even layer. Cook for about 1 minute, or until the surface loses its shine and looks dry and the edges begin to lift slightly. Flip the crepe gently with a spatula and cook the other side for about 30 seconds, or until lightly golden.

	•	Transfer the crepe to a plate. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding 1/2 tablespoon of butter to the skillet before cooking each crepe. This recipe yields approximately 5 large (10-inch) crepes. 
Notes
	•	Batter Consistency: The batter should be thin enough to spread easily but not watery. If it seems too thick, add a tablespoon of milk at a time until it reaches the right consistency.
	•	First Crepe Tip: Don’t worry if your first crepe isn’t perfect! It’s often a test run to ensure the pan is properly heated and greased.
	•	Make Ahead: You can make the batter up to 24 hours in advance. Store it in the refrigerator and give it a quick whisk before using.
	•	Yield: This recipe yields approximately 5 large (10-inch) crepes or 10 smaller (6-inch) crepes.
