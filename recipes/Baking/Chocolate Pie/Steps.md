		Bake and cool pie shells
		
		Combine the sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a medium saucepan. Stir or whisk together.
		 Pour in milk/cream and eggs, and whisk together.
		 Stir over medium heat until the mixture just barely comes to a boil and becomes thick, about 6 to 8 minutes (maybe less, maybe more; just watch it). The second it starts to bubble and thicken (it should be thick like pudding), remove it from the heat. Add the chocolate, vanilla, and butter, and stir until everything is beautifully combined. 
		 Pour the pudding into the pie crusts and place in the fridge to chill for 4 hours uncovered.
		 Cut into slices and serve with whipped cream!
