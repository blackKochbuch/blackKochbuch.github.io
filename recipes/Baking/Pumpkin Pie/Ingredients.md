INSTRUCTIONS

 
MAKE THE PIE CRUST:
		Place flour, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse a few times to combine. (Alternatively, the pie dough may be made by hand in a large bowl using a pastry cutter to blend in the butter and a fork to bring the dough together.) 
		Add the cold butter cubes and pulse until the largest pieces of butter are the size of small peas, about 8 pulses. Add the ice-cold water and pulse until the dough just comes together, adding more water by the teaspoonful as needed. 
		Turn dough out onto a floured work surface and form into a round disk. Roll the dough into a 12-inch round. Transfer dough round to a 9-inch deep dish pie dish that is 2 inches deep by wrapping it partway around the rolling pin. Gently fit the dough into the pie dish, but do not press it down firmly against the dish. Trim the dough edges as needed around the pie plate and then fold edges under. Use your fingers to crimp the edges of the pie crust as desired. Place pie crust in refrigerator while you prepare the filling. 
MAKE THE PUMPKIN PIE FILLING:
		Preheat oven to 375° F. 
		In a large bowl, combine pumpkin puree, eggs, brown sugar, heavy cream and milk. Whisk until smooth. Add the cornstarch, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, allspice, nutmeg, and salt. Whisk until well combined and no clumps of cornstarch or spices remain. 
		Pour the filling into the unbaked pie crust. Bake at 375° for 40-55 minutes. Halfway through baking, check on the pie and loosely cover the pie crust with foil or use pie protectors to prevent the crust from over-browning The pie is done when the filling is set but the center jiggles just a little bit when you wiggle the pan. The pie will continue to set up as it cools. (Overbaking can cause cracks in the pie filling as it cools.) 
		Cool pie on a wire rack for 3 hours and then transfer to the refrigerator to chill for a few hours or overnight before serving. The pie flavor will develop overnight and it will taste even better on the second day.
