1
Warm milk in microwave for 40 sec,  (like warm bath but not hot)
pour in bowl  and sprinkle with yeast
Add:
Sugar
Egg
Egg yolk
Melted buter
Mix until well combined
Stir in flour and salt with wooden spoon until dough begins to form

2
With dough hook knead dough on medium speed for 8 min
(Dough should form into a nice ball and be slightly sticky. If it is too sticky (sticking to bottom of bowl) add 2 more tbs bread flour

3
Transfer dough ball to a well oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and warm towel.
Allow the dough to rise for 1 hour- 1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in size

4
After dough has doubled in size, transfer to well floured surface and roll out into a 14X9 inch rectangle. 
Spread softened butter over dough, leaving a 1/4 inch margin at the far side of the dough

5
In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar and cinnamon. Use your hands to sprinkle mixture over the buttered dough, then rub the brown sugar mixture into the butter

6
Tightly roll dough up, starting from 9 inch side and place seam side down, making sure to seal the edges of the dough as best as you can. You will probably have to cut off about an inch off the ends of the dough as the ends won’t be as full of cinnamon sugar as we’d want it to be

7
Cut into 1 inch sections with a serrated knife or floss. You should get 9 large pieces

8
Place cinnamon rolls in a greased 9X9 inch baking pan or round 9 inch cake pan, parchment paper lined
Cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel and let rise again for 30 - 45 min

9
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Remove plastic wrap and towel and bake cinnamon rolls for 20-25 minutes or until just slightly golden brown on the edges. You want to undertake them a little so they stay soft in the middle.
Allow them to cool for 5 - 10 min before frosting

10 Make frosting:
With electric mixer beat until smooth and fluffy
Cream cheese
Butter
Powdered sufar
Vanilla extract

11.
Spread over cinnamon rolls and serve immediately
