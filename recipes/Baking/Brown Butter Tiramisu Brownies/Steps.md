﻿﻿﻿In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and both sugars. Whisk fast, until the sugar is fully dissolved and the mixture is frothy. Whisk in the vanilla.
﻿﻿﻿Once the chocolate mixture is cooled (it's fine if it's still a little warm), stream it into the egg/sugar mixture as you whisk to combine.
﻿﻿﻿Fold in flour and salt. Then, fold in the chocolate chips (make sure the batter isn't too warm before adding them).

5. Layer and assemble:
﻿﻿﻿Pour half of the batter into the bottom of the prepared baking pan.
﻿﻿﻿One by one, dunk each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture and place on top of the brownie batter in the pan.
﻿﻿﻿Pour the remaining brownie batter on top and spread.
