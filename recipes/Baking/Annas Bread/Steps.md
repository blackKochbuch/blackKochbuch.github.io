1.	Weigh: 400 g filtered water
2.	Mix in:	200 g sourdough starter
Float test: Floating indicates Sourdough starter is active/ready to be used
3.	Add: 600 g flour
79.2% AP unbleached flour 	(475 g)
21.8% whole wheat flour	(125 g)
				 600 g
4.	Combine: until smooth
5.	Autolyze - 30 minutes
leave in a warm place with no drafts and cover with plastic wrap
6.	Weigh: 12 g salt 
2 g NaCl / 100 g flourtotal
7.	Combine:  NaCl to Autolyze with a sprinkle of water
Crimp NaCl into dough mixture using fingertips until sufficiently incorporated
8.	Knead – 10 minutes
I use slap & fold method: grab side, lift, slam down and fold away. Repeat
Window-pane test: pull a sample of dough and stretch until thin – 
 if light penetrates and creates a ‘window-pane’ without ripping, dough is sufficiently kneaded.
9.	Rest – 4 hours
10.	Shape: 
Move dough from container to an un-floured surface
Sprinkle top with flour, and flip over
fold edges into the center to create a rough ball shape
Let sit seam side down, and cover
11.	Bench Rest – 30 minutes
12.	Final Shape:
Sprinkle with flour + flip
Keep in mind the folding of an envelope: 
13.	Transfer to banneton
Alternatively, I use a bowl covered by a tea towel, sprinkled with flour
14.	Fridge Rest – Overnight (6-24 hours)
This proofing process promotes the development of the sour flavour of the dough
↑time = ↑tang 
15.	Preheat Oven: 500F (260C)
Preheat Dutch oven > 20 minutes
16.	Score: 
Flip proofing bowl onto parchment paper, remove bowl and tea-towel
Score with razor blade: allows bread to expand in a controlled fashion + hella stylish
17.	Bake:
Place in Dutch oven with lid  into oven
REDUCE TEMPERATURE: 500F (260C)  430F (221C)
Bake for 25 minutes (uninterrupted) – the steam generated from the hot Dutch oven helps the dough rise
At 25 minutes, remove Dutch oven LID
Continue to Bake for another 25 minutes
 Total bake time = 50 minutes
18.	Rest – 30 minutes
19.	Serve
