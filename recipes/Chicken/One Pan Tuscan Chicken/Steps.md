1. Preheat the oven to 375*F. 
2. Combine cream, sundried tomatoes, spinach, and *garlic (see note) in the bottom of a 10-inch oven-proof skillet. 

3. Season chicken well on both sides with sea salt, pepper, and paprika. Nestle into the sauce. Sprinkle over Parmesan cheese and dot with the diced butter.
4. Place skillet in oven and bake for 30-35 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 165*F. Remove from oven and tent with foil to rest for 5 minutes.

5. Sprinkle over chopped parsley before serving.



Tips: 

		For a softer garlic taste, grate 1/2 of a garlic clove over the chicken before adding the Parm.
		Serve the chicken over pasta, rice, or mashed potatoes.
		To make an extra sauce: Remove the chicken to a plate and tent it with foil. Heat the remaining sauce in the skillet over medium-high while whisking in 1/2 cup of white wine. When the sauce has bubbled and is slightly reduced, remove from heat and spoon over the chicken or serve on the side.
