		1 kg				 chicken thighs, cut in pieces
	(thighs are usually more tender, juicer but breasts work as well and so does pork tenderloin)

		1 Tbs 			Sambal Oelek
		3/8 cup 		soy sauce
		1 					normal onion, chopped
        		(If I have a big onion, I chop it and freeze half)
		1 package 	Boursin cheese
	  		(substitute with 4 cloves of garlic, 1/2 cup whipping cream, 
			1 tsp chicken broth)
		300 g 			mushrooms, washed and quartered
		1/2 tsp 		black pepper
		1/2 cup 		white wine
		Chicken broth ( dissolve 3 tsp chicken broth in 1 cup boiling water)
		3 Tbs 			Flour, dissolved in just enough cold water to form a 					pudding like liquid
		1 cup 			whipping cream 

		750 g 		Spätzle, boiled in very salty water (1/8 cup salt)
