Season both sides of chicken breast with salt and pepper.
﻿﻿﻿Next heat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat and add a splash of olive oil to the pan. Once hot, place your chicken breasts in the pan and sear for 2-3 minutes per side. Then remove your chicken from the pan and stuff them with your sliced apples and brie. (At this point you can secure the chicken with toothpicks in case you're nervous about the filling spilling out.)

To make the stuffed chicken:
﻿﻿﻿Preheat your oven to 400 degrees.
﻿﻿﻿Then lay your chicken breasts flat on a cutting board and cut a slit into each one about ¾ of the way through. Season both sides with salt and pepper.
﻿﻿﻿Next heat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat and add a splash of olive oil to the pan. Once hot, place your chicken breasts in the pan and sear for 2-3 minutes per side. Then remove your chicken from the pan and stuff them with your sliced apples and brie. (At this point you can secure the chicken with toothpicks in case you're nervous about the filling spilling out.)
﻿﻿﻿Return your chicken back to the cast iron and brush them with your glaze.
Then place the cast iron in the oven and bake for 20-22 minutes or until the chicken is cooked all the way through.
(The internal temperature should be 165 degrees once they're done.)

Notes
Don't have a cast iron? Simply sear your chicken in a skillet and transfer them to a baking dish to bake!
*Double the glaze & keep the two batches separate - then use one for brushing over your chicken and one for serving!
