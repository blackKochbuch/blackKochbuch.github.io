	•	Place chicken breast in a large Ziploc bag. 
	•	In a small bowl, whisk together mustard, honey, olive oil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
	•	Let marinate for at least 30 minutes 
	•	Heat grill to medium or medium-high heat. Once the grill is heated, place chicken on the clean grill.
	•	Cook for 3-5 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of chicken breast. The FDA recommends the internal temperature to be 165 degrees. The chicken will continue to cook for 1-2 minutes after removing from the grill.
 •	Let rest for several minutes before cutting so it stays nice and juicy.
